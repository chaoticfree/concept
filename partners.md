# Terms of partnership

## Who are formal partners?

Formal partners of the DSX are community intermediaries and points of contact for organizations, networks, and individuals looking for digital security training assistance and capacity. They act as connectors in a growing circle of trust by bringing  organizational leaders, organizers, and technologists to the exchange platform. 

In addition, formal partners establish criteria and evaluate incoming capacity building volunteers to ensure that trainers are properly matched to communities in terms of technical knowledge, political alignment, sector experience and social identity.

To be a formal partner, you must be one of the following: 

- A movement or technology organization working with frontline communities including but not limited to African American, South Asian, Muslim American, Latino, Indigenous, immigrant, refugee, LGBTQ, human rights, women's rights, journalists, religious minorities, and other communities;
