# DSX next steps and workplan, March 2017

## **Partners/Intermediaries**
 
*Action*: Invite formal partners to join DSX and to act as community intermediaries — points of contact for communities who need capacity and capacity builders who want to offer assistance. Partners would be organizations and individuals or networks representing distinct communities. This will be U.S.-only for now.  They will: 

	- Help identify and route requests for assistance
	- Identify funding to move resources to communities and trainers
	- Connect  tech-savvy people in communities and orgs to capacity builders and incoming orgs seeking assistance 
	- DSX staff act as traffic cops/gardeners

*How*: Build a process for bringing on partners 

	- Membership agreement for partner orgs and agreement on approach, curriculum, practices, Hippocratic oath, guiding principles 
	- Each partner org will establish a point of contact who will connect to those seeking assistance and those seeking to assist
	- Respecting capacity issues, minimize partner time spent

*Tech* (TBD): Simple, secure, and possibly off-the-shelf database/CRM to manage partner data (community involvement, internal expertise,  unique skills, unique needs)

## **Capacity builders** 

*Action*:  Invite capacity builders and trainers to offer assistance 

*How:*  Online forms and vetting 

	- Intake form for those offering assistance, with simple questionnaire to identify expertise and cultural sensitivity
	- Implement a vetting process to assess technical expertise and cultural competence/sensitivity
	- DSX staff follow up in person, connect orgs to capacity builders
	- CRM to register background, history, expertise, and demographics to suggest connections to those seeking assistance 

## **Orgs seeking assistance** 

*Action*: Invite organizations and communities to use DSX to seek out capacity building assistance and digital security training (it is NOT a rapid response helpline)

*How:* Online forms on the site and a secure CRM.

	- Intake form for those seeking assistance, with simple questionnaire to identify needs
	- CRM to register background, history, expertise, and demographics to suggest connections to capacity builders  

## **Trust, quality, and standards**
 
*Action*: Establish the “DSX Model,” including:
     
	- Standard of quality - and how we get there
	- Our values
	- Process - and challenge - of working across different cultural contexts
	- Process for establishing trust and vetting capacity builders
	- Process for empowering those already working within frontline communities - investing in expertise
	- Establishing criteria for becoming a “trusted trainer”:
		- Technical skills
		- Cultural sensitivity
		- Teaching ability
	- Process for developing technical recommendations
	- Process for working within an organization to implement changes

*How*: Working group collaborates on posts on DSX.org, which become canonical (though ever-evolving) documents, hosted on a DSX knowledgebase.

*TBD*: Resources and plan to place capacity builders for long-term assistance, making sure things stick 

## **Curriculum development and documentation**
 
*Action*: Work with the community and DSX network to create a more centralized curriculum or guidelines for best practices. 

	- Establish a common, open format (plaintext/Markdown/git)
	- DSX staff maintain repository and, with volunteer support, format docs
	- List existing docs, but also float up most up-to-date and useful
	- Partner with authors to keep docs up-to-date
	- Include or develop documentation about changing organizations: managing up, convincing leadership of need for change, changing culture and habits
	- Focus on long-term capacity

*How*: Bring on DSX staff to establish and manage documentation and outreach program. 

## **Website/platform**

*Action:* Develop plan for website that houses all of the above pieces and communicates the mission of the DSX project  

*How:* Work with  digital agency to develop messaging plan and site structure, to include: 

	- Landing page w/list of partners 
	- Secure contact page for capacity builders and orgs in need 
	- About/working group 
	- Documentation hub 
	- Content - writing about standards, threat modeling, processes, recommendations (knowledgebase)

*TBD*: Develop our own internal threat model that can guide the development of our DSX digital platform
